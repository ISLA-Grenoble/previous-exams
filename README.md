# Previous exams for ISLA and SADM

In this repository you will find some exams given in previous years for this course.

Each year, the students did the exams in one of the computers from the TP rooms. They were given a `zip` files with several documents, such as the instructions for the exam, the `rmd` files to complete with their reponses to each question, the course's textbook, slides for some classes, etc. The students' computers didn't have any internet access, so they were not allowed to install any new `R` packages that we not previously provided by the professor.

:warning: The corrections of the exams **may have some errors**, so do not hesitate to open an issue in this repository pointing towards the problem so we can help you out.

PS: Please note that the course used to be called "Statistical Analysis and Document Mining" (SADM) and that some new contents have been added for ISLA.
